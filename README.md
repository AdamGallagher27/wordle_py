# Wordle Clones in Python with Pygame

This repository contains two Python implementations of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, using the Pygame library. One version offers a graphical interface (GUI), while the other is a command-line version.

## GUI Version
The GUI version lets you guess words in a visually interactive environment. Run python wordle_gui.py to play.

## CLI Version
The command-line version provides a lightweight text-based experience. Run python wordle_cli.py to play.

## Why This Project
This project demonstrates my Python and Pygame skills. It showcases game development versatility in both GUI and command-line settings.
